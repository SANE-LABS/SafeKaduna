# Community Safety App for Kaduna State

### Team Name: [Your Group Name Here]

### Project Overview

In Kaduna State, residents face significant safety concerns, including crime, violence, and gender-based violence (GBV). Many people feel vulnerable due to the lack of real-time safety information and the absence of reliable systems for distress alerts. This project aims to enhance community safety through a mobile-based app that offers real-time insights and distress communication features, fostering a connected and protected community.

### Problem Statement

Residents, especially women and girls in Kaduna, are at high risk due to:
1. **Widespread Gender-Based Violence**: 8 out of 10 women and girls face some form of GBV.
2. **Lack of Real-Time Safety Information**: No accessible safety systems offer current updates on dangerous zones or incidents.
3. **Ineffective Distress Communication**: Limited reliable methods for individuals, particularly GBV victims, to alert loved ones or authorities.
4. **Absence of Community-Based Protection**: Lack of coordinated safety networks leaves many isolated and vulnerable.
5. **Insufficient Awareness and Prevention Tools**: Limited resources for residents, especially women and girls, to stay informed and proactive about their safety.

These issues are often compounded by socio-economic challenges, including poverty and limited access to education, which heighten the risks faced by women and girls in the community.

### Solution

We are developing a community-driven mobile app to enhance safety in Kaduna through real-time data and innovative technology. Key features include:

- **Danger Zone Reporting**: Users can report dangerous areas, creating a live map for community awareness.
- **Audio Distress Detection**: In high-risk zones, the app can detect audio distress, like gunshots or distress calls, and automatically record when users are unable to use their phones, such as in cases of assault.
- **Instant Location Sharing**: When a distress signal is detected, the app automatically sends the user’s real-time location to selected friends and family members.
- **AI-driven Environmental Classification**: The app uses machine learning to classify environmental sounds, alerting users if they enter zones with potentially dangerous noise patterns.

This app empowers individuals with knowledge about their surroundings, giving them a sense of security and enabling quick alerts for support when needed.

### Expected Impact

With this app, we aim to:
- Provide **real-time updates** for informed and confident navigation in the community.
- Ensure **immediate support** through automatic distress alerts to trusted contacts.
- **Foster community solidarity** by enabling users to share safety information and look out for each other.
- Contribute to **reducing GBV incidents** by equipping users with practical tools for safety and rapid response.
